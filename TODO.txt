Bugs
= Rescale bars on zoom
= Sort tables in same order as bars
= Dates are out of order
= Remove "default" or "unknown" values from plots

Branding
= Use the stacked/square logo on the log-in page and the horizontal logo on the header of the dashboard
= Adjust style to AMPA_Style_Guide.pdf

If we can add AmPA! into file names, like the excel template, that would be great. I would also add that to the title of the dashboard. Lastly, if it's possible to change the URL to americanpetsalive, rather than austinpetsalive (would be https://github.com/americanpetsalive/gapapp) that would be good.
