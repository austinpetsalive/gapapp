# Gap App
This is a flask server which takes a spreadsheet (populated from a template I provide) and does a Gap Analysis to assist shelters in determining how to allocate resources and what problems to address. This was formerly done through worksheets which can be found [here](https://americanpetsalive.org/uploads/resources/Lifesavingworkbook.pdf).
